# Mitochondria in the Layer 2/3 Volume
Visualization and analysis of mitochondria by voxel (volume) and counts per cell.

A special thanks to Nick Turner for his advice and help. Read Nick and his Microns Consortium colleagues' Cell paper [*Reconstruction of neocortex: Organelles, compartments, cells, circuits, and activity*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092867422001349) for more details.  

See the Microns explorer page at the [Allen Brain Institute](https://www.microns-explorer.org/terms-and-conditions) for more details, terms and conditions.

# Summary Presentation

### View the [**Mitochondria**](https://github.com/shandran/layer23-volume/blob/main/mitochondria/mitochondria_layer23_volume.pdf) summary presentation file, with lots of visualization examples of mitchondria in neurons and glia.

## Anaconda Notebook files

The main analysis was conducted using [`mito_voxel_analysis_vasc_removed.ipynb`](https://github.com/shandran/layer23-volume/blob/main/mitochondria/mito_voxel_analysis_vasc_removed.ipynb). This notebook removes the vascular cells and all the partial processes from cells where the soma is not located in the volume. The cell subtypes table [`220309_cell_type_classification.csv`](https://github.com/shandran/layer23-volume/blob/main/data/220309_cell_type_classification.csv) was used to provide identifying information for the neuron or glial cell of interest.

Use [`mito_voxel_analysis_entire_table.ipynb`](https://github.com/shandran/layer23-volume/blob/main/mitochondria/mito_voxel_analysis_entire_table.ipynb) to look up mitochondria segmentation data on any cell id in the volume. This includes a substantial number of partial processes from cells where the soma is not located in the volume.

Note: The mitochondria table is too large to place on GitHub. You will need to download this file to your local computer in order to run these Anaconda notebook files.
