## Mis-segmented synaptic bouton
A synaptic bouton with a compound synapse was assigned to the oligodendrocyte cell. Looking at the raw electromicrographs in Neuroglancer, you can see that a nearby axon is continuous with the synaptic bouton, but the segmentation algorithm made an error. The Microns Consortium estimates an approximate 10% segmentation error, so errors such as these are not uncommon.
